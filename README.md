# Sales Insight-Data-Analysis Using PowerBI(Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design a dynamic Power BI dashboard to track key sales metrics (Sales, Profit, and Quantity) across four regions (Central, East, South, and West). The dashboard allows users to:
•	Filter by year and dynamically switch between Sales, Profit, and Quantity.
•	Compare Current Year (CY) vs. Previous Year (PY) Sales.
•	Analyze state-wise sales performance using Bubble Maps & Bar Charts.
•	Gain insights through interactive KPIs and visualizations.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/sriramnagabothu/Sales-Insigts-Data-Analysis-Using-PowerBI/blob/main/Sales%20Overview%20Data.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
Regional Sales Performance
•	Display Sales, Profit, and Quantity for each region (Central, East, South, West) based on the selected year.
•	Allow users to dynamically switch between metrics.
•	Show Previous Year (PY) Sales for comparison.
•	Include bar sparkline charts for monthly trends, with an average line.
Sales by State
•	Bubble Map visualization, where bubble size represents sales volume.
•	Bar Chart for a detailed breakdown of state-wise sales.
•	Ability to sort bars in ascending/descending order.
KPI Metrics Table
The table Should include the following columns for comparative analysis:
•	CY Sales, PY Sales, YoY Sales Growth/Decline
•	CY Profit, PY Profit, YoY Profit Growth/Decline
•	CY Quantity, PY Quantity, YoY Quantity Growth/Decline

•	Regional Sales Trends: Identified top-performing and underperforming regions based on YoY growth.
•	 State-wise Sales Performance: Highlighted high-revenue and low-revenue states via Bubble Map & Bar Chart.
•	 Sales vs. Profit Analysis: Showed regions with high sales but low profit margins, helping in strategy optimization.
•	 Monthly Trends & Seasonality: Sparkline analysis revealed peak sales months and seasonal fluctuations.
•	 KPI-driven Decision Making: The dashboard enabled stakeholders to quickly assess performance & take data-driven actions.

## Final Conclusion:
This Power BI Sales Overview Dashboard provides an interactive, data-driven solution for tracking regional and state-wise sales trends. It enhances business decision-making by offering real-time insights into sales, profit, and quantity metrics, helping businesses identify growth opportunities and optimize performance.
