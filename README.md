# Sales Insight-Data-Analysis Using PowerBI(Interactive Dashboard creation)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design a dynamic Power BI dashboard to track key sales metrics (Sales, Profit, and Quantity) across four regions (Central, East, South, and West).<br>The dashboard allows users to:<br>
•	Filter by year and dynamically switch between Sales, Profit, and Quantity.<br>
•	Compare Current Year (CY) vs. Previous Year (PY) Sales.<br>
•	Analyze state-wise sales performance using Bubble Maps & Bar Charts.<br>
•	Gain insights through interactive KPIs and visualizations.<br>

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/sriramnagabothu/Sales-Insigts-Data-Analysis-Using-PowerBI/blob/main/Sales%20Overview%20Data.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)<br>
Regional Sales Performance<br>
•	Display Sales, Profit, and Quantity for each region (Central, East, South, West) based on the selected year.<br>
•	Allow users to dynamically switch between metrics.<br>
•	Show Previous Year (PY) Sales for comparison.<br>
•	Include bar sparkline charts for monthly trends, with an average line.<br>
Sales by State<br>
•	Bubble Map visualization, where bubble size represents sales volume.<br>
•	Bar Chart for a detailed breakdown of state-wise sales.<br>
•	Ability to sort bars in ascending/descending order.<br>
KPI Metrics Table<br>
The table Should include the following columns for comparative analysis:<br>
•	CY Sales, PY Sales, YoY Sales Growth/Decline<br>
•	CY Profit, PY Profit, YoY Profit Growth/Decline<br>
•	CY Quantity, PY Quantity, YoY Quantity Growth/Decline<br>

## Process<br>
•	Requirement Gathering: Defined business needs and key performance indicators (KPIs).<br>
•	Data Walkthrough: Analyzed dataset structure and attributes.<br>
•	Data Connection: Connected Power BI to the sales dataset.<br>
•	Data Cleaning & Quality Check: Removed inconsistencies, missing values, and ensured accuracy.<br>
•	Data Modeling: Created relationships between tables for optimized performance.<br>
•	DAX Calculations: Implemented measures for YoY comparisons, KPIs, and aggregations.<br>
•	Dashboard Design & Layouting: Structured the dashboard for user-friendly navigation.<br>
•	Visualization & Formatting: Developed charts, tables, and maps to enhance insights.<br>
•	Report Development & Insights Generation: Finalized dashboard and extracted business insights.<br>

•	Regional Sales Trends: Identified top-performing and underperforming regions based on YoY growth.<br>
•	 State-wise Sales Performance: Highlighted high-revenue and low-revenue states via Bubble Map & Bar Chart.<br>
•	 Sales vs. Profit Analysis: Showed regions with high sales but low profit margins, helping in strategy optimization.<br>
•	 Monthly Trends & Seasonality: Sparkline analysis revealed peak sales months and seasonal fluctuations.<br>
•	 KPI-driven Decision Making: The dashboard enabled stakeholders to quickly assess performance & take data-driven actions.<br>

## Final Conclusion:
This Power BI Sales Overview Dashboard provides an interactive, data-driven solution for tracking regional and state-wise sales trends. It enhances business decision-making by offering real-time insights into sales, profit, and quantity metrics, helping businesses identify growth opportunities and optimize performance.
